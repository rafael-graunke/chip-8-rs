# CHIP-8 in Rust

This project started as a way for me to learn:

- Low-level stuff;
- Rust;
- Hardware/Console emulation.

(I'm new to all of the above)

I've started the main implementation but decide to start over and document my progress here.

I'll soon add a checklist of goals and features that have to be implemented, as well as more docs as needed.
